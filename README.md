This is a (hopefully) simple implementation of Quantitative Type Theory, in TypeScript.

Try it out at https://atennapel.github.io/qtt-ts

Run CLI REPL:
```
yarn install
yarn start
```

Typecheck file:
```
yarn install
yarn start example.p
```

Currently done:
- basic type theory with dependent functions and type-in-type

Not yet done:
- quantitative type theory
- sigma types
- erasure
